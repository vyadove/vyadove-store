# Why Shopnex?

Shopnex is a modern eCommerce starter built on **Payload CMS**, designed for flexibility, developer control, and fast iteration. Here's how it compares to other leading open-source platforms:

| Feature / Platform       | **Shopnex** (Payload-based)                                         | Medusa                                 | Saleor                                  | WooCommerce                                   | Vendure                                           |

| **Developer Experience** | ✅ Modern stack (Next.js / Vite), TypeScript, modular architecture  | ⚠️ JS/TS with CLI setup                | ❌ Django/GraphQL setup, higher barrier | ⚠️ PHP plugin ecosystem                       | ✅ TypeScript-first, GraphQL powered              |

| **Self-host or SaaS**    | ✅ Both – deploy yourself or use Shopnex SaaS                       | ✅ Self-hosted only                    | ✅ Self-hosted only                     | ✅ Self-hosted                                | ✅ Self-hosted                                    |
| **Multi-store/Tenant**   | ✅ Multi-tenant ready via Payload architecture                      | ⚠️ Manual config needed                | ✅ Multichannel support                 | ⚠️ Requires third-party plugins               | ✅ Multi-vendor and multi-channel support         |
| **API-first**            | ✅ REST + GraphQL with full control                                 | ✅ REST                                | ✅ GraphQL only                         | ⚠️ REST only, often messy                     | ✅ GraphQL-first, strongly typed                  |
| **Cost**                 | ✅ Free & open-source with optional SaaS                            | ✅ Free & open-source                  | ✅ Free (requires infra)                | ✅ Free core, paid plugins                    | ✅ Free & open-source                             |

## 🎯 Why Shopnex Stands Out

- 🔌 **Pluggable by default**: Payments, shipping, SEO, and more via modular plugins.
- 🧱 **Block-driven UI**: Create reusable, customizable UI sections with real content.
- 🛠 **Full control**: Own your stack – deploy it anywhere, tweak everything.
- ⚡️ **Fast dev cycle**: Modern tooling, built-in CMS, and support for visual editing.
