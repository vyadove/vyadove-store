# 📢 Campaigns

Campaigns let you reach your customers with **email** or **SMS** messages — whether it’s a **newsletter**, **promotion**, or **update**.  
From the Campaigns dashboard, you can draft messages, choose who receives them, and track how well they perform.

## ✍️ Creating a Campaign

1. **Click “New Campaign”** from the Campaigns page.
2. Enter a **name** (e.g. “Black Friday Promo”).
3. Choose the **type**:
    - **Email** → Send a custom email with subject and template.
    - **SMS** → Send a short text message.
4. Pick a **status**:
    - **Draft** → Save your work, but don’t send yet.
    - **Scheduled** → Prepare for automatic sending later.
    - **Sent** → Already sent (read-only).
    - **Paused** → Stop sending midway.

## 💌 Email Campaigns

If you select **Email**:

- Add a **subject line** for your email.
- Choose an **email template** (pre-built or custom).
- Set the **From** and **Reply-To** addresses.
- Optionally, provide **template data** (like customer name or promo code) to personalize each message.

<details>
<summary>Example: Template Personalization</summary>

If your template says:  
`Hi {{name}}, enjoy 20% off your next order!`

And you add `name = Sarah` in Template Data, the customer will receive:  
**“Hi Sarah, enjoy 20% off your next order!”**

</details>

## 👥 Adding Recipients

- Select which **customers or users** should receive the campaign.
- You can choose multiple recipients at once.

    Tip: Use filters or customer groups (like “VIP Customers” or “Recent
    Buyers”) for better targeting.
</Callout>

## 📊 Tracking Campaign Performance

Once your campaign is sent, you’ll see **metrics update automatically**:

- **Sent** → How many messages were delivered.
- **Opened** → How many emails were opened.
- **Clicked** → How many people clicked a link inside.

This helps you measure what’s working and improve future campaigns.

## 🚀 Typical Workflow

1. Draft a campaign with your **message and template**.
2. Select your **audience** (recipients).
3. Schedule or send immediately.
4. Monitor results in the **metrics dashboard**.
