```bash
npx create-builder-storefront@latest ...
```

This command will:

- Automatically set up a ready-to-use project with Builder integrated in **Custom Storefront** mode

Once it's installed, follow the instructions in the terminal to start the development server and view your storefront.

> 💡 You can always customize the components, styles, and routing to fit your brand after installation.
