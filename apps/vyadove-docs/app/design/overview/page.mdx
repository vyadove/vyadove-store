# Overview

The **Design** section in Shopnex empowers you to visually build and manage your storefront using [Builder.io](https://builder.io)â€”a powerful drag-and-drop editor with full control over layout, styling, and content.

Whether you're using a Shopnex template or connecting your own custom frontend (like Next.js), Builder.io helps you go from idea to live design with zero friction.

- Use visual blocks to design product pages, homepages, and more

- Integrate directly with your custom frontend using Builder.ioâ€™s **Custom Storefront** mode
