# CJ Dropshipping Plugin Setup

This guide walks you through configuring the CJ Dropshipping integration plugin.

## 🔐 Credentials

Begin by filling in the **required** credentials to authenticate with the CJ Dropshipping API.

> ⚠️ Only **Email Address** and **API Token** are required.  
> Other fields (**Refresh Token**, **Access Token**, and their expiry fields\*\*) will be updated automatically by the system. You should only modify them manually in rare or advanced cases (e.g. debugging or token override).

| Field                    | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email Address**        | ✅ Required – the email associated with your CJ Dropshipping account.       |
| **API Token**            | ✅ Required – the API token provided by CJ Dropshipping for authentication. |
| **Refresh Token**        | Auto-managed – used to renew your access token when it expires.             |
| **Refresh Token Expiry** | Auto-managed – the date and time when the refresh token becomes invalid.    |
| **Access Token**         | Auto-managed – temporary token used to authorize requests.                  |
| **Access Token Expiry**  | Auto-managed – the expiry date and time for the access token.               |

### 🛠️ How to Get Your Email & API Token

If you're not sure where to get this information, follow these steps:

1. **Create an account** at [CJ Dropshipping](https://app.cjdropshipping.com/).
2. After logging in, go to the **Authorization** section in your account dashboard.
3. Click **API** from the sidebar.
4. Create a new store integration if needed.
5. You’ll be presented with an **API Key** — this is your **API Token**.
6. Use the **email you registered with CJ** as the **Email Address**.

> Make sure to keep your API token secure. Treat it like a password — never share it publicly.

## 🖼️ Logo Area POD

This section is for customizing your Print-on-Demand (POD) logo:

- Click **Create New** to upload a new logo.
- Or select **Choose from existing** to use a previously uploaded logo.
- You can also drag and drop a logo file directly into the box.

> Logos will be associated with your POD products during sync.

## 🛒 Products

List the products you want to sync with CJ Dropshipping:

### Adding a Product

Each product requires a **Product URL**:

```txt
https://cjdropshipping.com/product/mens-t-shirt-t-shirt-overalls-p-2503190327561613000.html
```

You can add multiple product URLs by clicking **Add Product** in the UI.

---

### Example

```json
{
    "productUrl": "https://cjdropshipping.com/product/mens-t-shirt-t-shirt-overalls-p-2503190327561613000.html"
}
```

---

## ✅ Saving Configuration

Once all the required fields are filled, click **Save** in the top-right corner to store your configuration.

This will allow the system to begin syncing your credentials, POD logos, and selected products with CJ Dropshipping's API.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Product URL?** Ensure you're using the correct CJ product URL format.
- **No Logo?** If you don't upload a logo, your POD products may appear unbranded.
