# 💳 Connect Your Stripe Account

To start accepting payments in your store, connect your **Stripe** account by providing the required credentials below.

> 🛍️ This plugin is built for SaaS eCommerce platforms — each store can use its own Stripe account.

---

## 🛠 Required Information

You’ll need to collect the following values from your Stripe dashboard:

| Field               | Where to find it      | Example                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Publishable Key** | Developers → API keys | `pk_live_...`                  |
| **Secret Key**      | Developers → API keys | `sk_live_...`                  |
| **Webhook Secret**  | Developers → Webhooks | `whsec_...`                    |
| **Test Mode**       | (Optional toggle)     | Enable if you're still testing |

---

## 📘 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Log in to your Stripe account

Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

---

### 2. Get your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

- In the sidebar, go to **Developers → API keys**
- Copy:
    - `Publishable key` → use in the "Publishable Key" field
    - `Secret key` → click "Reveal live key" and copy it

> ⚠️ **Never share your Secret Key.** Paste it only into your Stripe plugin settings.

---

### 3. Create a Webhook Secret

1. Go to **Developers → Webhooks**
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. Use the following URL:

```

[https://your-store.com/api/stripe/webhook](https://your-store.com/api/stripe/webhook)

```

4. Under **Events to send**, select:

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `invoice.paid`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

5. Click **Add endpoint**
6. After it's created, click it, and copy the **"Signing secret"** — that is your **Webhook Secret**

---

## ⚙️ Fill in the Plugin Settings

Once you have all the credentials, return to the **Stripe Settings** page in your admin dashboard and enter:

```plaintext
✔ Publishable Key
✔ Secret Key
✔ Webhook Secret
✔ Enable Test Mode (if needed)
```

> 🧪 If you're testing your store, use Stripe **test keys** starting with `pk_test_`, `sk_test_`, and **test cards** (like `4242 4242 4242 4242`).

---

## ✅ You're Ready!

Once connected:

- Customers can pay using credit/debit cards securely via Stripe.
- You can receive payouts from Stripe based on your country and banking info.
- Webhooks will update orders and subscriptions automatically.

---

## 🧠 Tips for Developers

If you're a developer or advanced user:

- Use [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to test webhooks locally
- Rotate your secret keys periodically
- Make sure webhook routes are **protected and verified**
