# ✉️ Easy Email

The **Easy Email Plugin** lets you design, customize, and send professional emails directly from your dashboard — no coding required.  
With the drag-and-drop editor, anyone can create polished templates in just a few minutes.

---

## 🎨 Drag-and-Drop Builder

- **Content Blocks**: Add text, images, buttons, social links, dividers, tables, and more.
- **Layouts**: Quickly structure your email with sections, columns, and groups.
- **Branding**: Upload your logo, set fonts, and choose your brand colors.

<Callout type="info">
    What you see in the editor is exactly what your customers will see in their
    inbox.
</Callout>

## ⚙️ Page Attributes

On the right-hand panel, you can configure email settings:

- **Subject** → The subject line your recipients will see.
- **Subtitle** → Optional preview text.
- **Width & Breakpoint** → Control how your design looks on desktop vs mobile.
- **Theme Settings** → Adjust font family, size, line height, colors, and background.

---

## 👤 Personalization

Use **variables** to make each email feel personal.

For example, add:

```

Hi {{user_name}},

```

When sent, this will automatically turn into:

```

Hi Sarah,

```

for a user named Sarah. That can be configured in the template data of a campaign.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Choose a template or start from scratch.
2. Drag in content blocks (text, images, buttons, etc.).
3. Customize colors, fonts, and styles to match your brand.
4. Personalize your message with variables (e.g. `{{user_name}}`).
5. Save the template and use it in a campaign.

---

## 📊 Best Practices

- Keep subject lines **short and engaging**.
- Use **personalization** to increase open rates.
- Add a clear **call-to-action button**.
- Preview on **desktop and mobile** before sending.

<Callout type="warning">
    Make sure your template includes an **unsubscribe link** if you’re sending
    marketing emails — it’s legally required in most countries.
</Callout>
